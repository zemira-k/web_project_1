The main problem with education

Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests. 

Here's the real question: does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?

Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.

Learning Techniques 
Five Strategies from Barbara Oakley

Two Ways of Thinking 
Deep understanding comes from being able to toggle back and forth between focused and diffused thinking.

Recall 
Improving your ability to remember key bits of information helps to connect different parts of the brain.

Interleaving 
When you learn multiple skills at the same time, they reinforce each other.

Questions 
When listening to your teacher, think up a good question, something that you're really itching to know.

Illusion of Competence 
Test yourself, write it down, tell other people, and repeat the process in different settings. Only then can you be truly certain you've understood something.

Barbara Oakley’s story. 

Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of herself as more of a 
humanities person, and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after 
school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, 
during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study 
engineering. In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was 
forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out that when something 
doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people 
may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
